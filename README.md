## Instructions

Lead the revolution! Free other moons and satellites! Take control of the planet! But beware, the planet will fight back...

- You start with one moon / satellite
- Select a moon with a left mouse click. Your moons will have a blue circle when selected
- Send ships from a satellite you control to any other with a right clic
- Control the percentage of ships you send order by clicking on the same moon, or on the green / shadow square
- If only your ships orbit a moon, you have freed it and it will help you
- Send a ship to the planet to win, but it will destroy all your ships if there are still occupied moons
- Once you freed all moons, the planet will trigger its shield
- The planet will send enormous fleet of ships to all moons, but they are mostly rubbish...
- Watch out for the asteroids!
